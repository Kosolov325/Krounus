The maps included in this repository are from the Persistent Kingdoms Scene Pack (https://forums.taleworlds.com/index.php/topic,382283.0.html).

Please see their conditions of use below:

```
Persistent Kingdoms Servers:
- You are free to use the scenes on your Persistent Kingdoms servers (not other modules).
- You are free to create derivative scenes and use them for your Persistent Kingdoms servers (not other modules). You may also distribute those creations for use in other Persistent Kingdom Servers. However, the terms presented here apply to any and all derivatives.
- No profit must be made using these scenes. If your server is taking donations that exclusively cover the server expenses you're free to use the scenes. Any other commercial venues are strictly forbidden.
- You must retain the original names of the scenes (even if you edit the scene yourself). Changing the scene names is not allowed.
- If your server is in any way breaking the TaleWorlds monetisation policy or breaking the modding guidelines described on the TaleWorlds forums you immediately lose the right to use the scenes and any scene derivatives.

Server Hosts:
- You are not allowed to in any way commercialize the scenes or use them to attract customers.
