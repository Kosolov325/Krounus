hint_1|Peasants are what everyone starts out as: they can do a bit of work, but have little training for combat.
hint_2|Serfs have no free time to train combat skills; but they are good at manual labour, with much experience.
hint_3|Militia are peasants with a little combat training; they aren't above doing a bit of labouring now and then.
hint_4|Huntsmen are peasants that have learned how to use a light bow, but they can still do labouring work.
hint_5|Craftsmen know how to design and repair the simpler things, but they aren't as skillful as engineers.
hint_6|Healers are peasants that have picked up some of the basic skills of treating wounds, but not near the skill of a doctor.
hint_7|Footmen are the basic combat troops of a faction: they are strong, agile, and especially good with polearms, but have not spent much time training with horses or ranged weapons.
hint_8|Archers are quite strong and agile, with a high tolerance to pain, but are not very skilled in hand to hand combat.
hint_9|Crossbowmen are similar to archers, though they have slightly more strength training with one handed weapons.
hint_10|Lancers are very fast horse riders, but are not very athletic because of spending so much time in the saddle.
hint_11|Men at arms are very well trained in hand to hand combat on horse and on foot, especially with two handed weapons; but reliance on horses makes them unlikely to win many foot races.
hint_12|Sergeants are specialised foot soldiers, skilled with two handed weapons.
hint_13|Engineers have spent most of their time learning how to build and repair things, so they often need more protection in combat than other troops.
hint_14|Master smiths have spent many years refining their skills to craft the most intricate and exceptional weapons and armor.
hint_15|Doctors have spent almost all of their life reading books and learning to perform delicate operations, so they are often very disadvantaged in a fight.
hint_16|Sailors are obviously the best for handling the sails on your ship, and they aren't bad as foot soldiers, but they can't run very fast on land.
hint_17|Travellers have learned to ride, sail, and run well, but haven't spent much time learning how to use weapons.
hint_18|Lords of a faction are often men at arms that have that little bit extra of strength or skill, as well as the ability to lead men.
hint_19|Ruffians are mostly big bullies with a lot of strength, but little skill.
hint_20|Brigands have less strength than ruffians, but have moderate skill with ranged weapons, and can be quite good at picking locks.
hint_21|Mercenaries are available when a faction has no castles left; they are average at most combat skills, but not masters of any.
hint_22|You can hold down the shift key to make your character walk.
